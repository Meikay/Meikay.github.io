A web scraper is a program that extracts data from websites and that data is stored in a local file or in a database. Instead of manually copying and pasting the data, the program will allow you to automate this process. It is customizable and depending on which website it is, may have to be updated every now and then.

The first step to getting your program to work is, it sends a get query to a specific website. Then, it parses an HTML document based on the result. After itâ€™s done, the scraper searches for the data within the document and converts it to the format of your choice.

An example of what web scraping can be useful for would be to gather a list of real estate properties where buyers can choose from a pool of relevant listings. Another example would be email marketing, where companies gather a list of emails and target them for ads. Web scaping is also used for machine learning and  a lot of other data driven companies.
