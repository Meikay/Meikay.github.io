The first time I was introduced to code was in high school. I decided to take an AP Computer Science course where I learned some HTML and Java. But it seemed like a bunch of gibberish that did some action on the world wide web but I didn't know what exactly. There were no mobile apps at the time and I didn't know much about the web, so I became bored. I told my teacher I was going to drop the class because I didn't want to take the AP exam. My teacher tried convincing me to stay because I was doing well, but I refused and said it wasn't worth my time. I didn't understand what code was used for or what its purpose was. So I decided to leave and always cringed at the thought of coding.
		 
Years later, I heard about how big tech companies were growing at a sizable pace and I was inspired by their success. Not only were they financially successful, but they were on the edge when it came to innovation. Being up-to-date on the latest technologies is something that appealed to me. What would the world be like in 10 years? I wanted in. So, I looked into how they built their companies and they all shared a common component... it all started with a line of code. So I was determined to learn how to code and I found that I actually enjoyed it.
		
My high school introduction to code was an unpleasant experience and the world of coding is beyond a CS101 AP course. The more I coded, the more I liked it. I learned that the world would be at my finger tips if I could just learn this amazing skill. I see becoming a software engineer as a creative outlet where I can design and build an application exactly the way I like. 
		
I also enjoy interacting with other developers. I attend meet ups, workshops, and conferences and get involved in online communities as well. During these events I can connect with others that share my passion for coding and building applications. The developer community is very welcoming where I can learn from knowledgeable people about new technologies. Learning is a passion of mine and with the ever changing world of tech, it means there is an endless sea of new technologies to be learned. It gives me the opportunity to have unlimited creative freedom where code is my paint brush and the web is my canvas.
